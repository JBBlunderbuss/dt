# HCard Test

## Installation
1. clone
2. cd dt/hcard
3. npm i
4. npm start

## Process
- install create react app
- install testing and type checking and code formating (prettier)
- clean up
- build main component
- build sub components
- style components

## Todo
- It could be a bit more polished with the responsiveness (I got a bit carried away with flexbox, which took up too much time)
- more accessibility, aria roles etc
- microformats 
- I could have added more to the inputs for some front-end validation type="phone" etc
